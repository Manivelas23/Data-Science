    "## Introduction to Bar Charts\n",
    "Now that we have seen what a bar chart looks like, let’s examine more in-depth how and when we utilize them! Bar charts are generally used to visualize the relative frequencies of categories within a variable. Therefore, they are primarily helpful for visually summarizing categorical variables rather than quantitative variables. If you can organize your variable into distinct categories, a bar chart is often a great option! If not, you may need to resort to a different visual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your distinct categories, a bar chart is best used to display the different value counts of each category. We can also compare means, but we would recommend using a side-by-side box plot for that instead because they give a full picture of the five-number summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vertical vs. Horizontal Bar Charts\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a bar chart, we have two axes. One axis represents the discrete values within a categorical variable we are comparing, while the other axis measures the counts of each of these values. Depending on how we orient these axes, we can either have a horizontal bar chart or a vertical bar chart. Let’s take a look at each below.\n",

    "* Bar charts are used for categorical variables, while histograms are used for quantitative data.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Plotting Bar Charts Using Seaborn\n",
    "Now that we know all about bar charts, let’s create our own in Python! To do this, we are going to use a library called seaborn. It creates powerful visuals without any syntax headaches, and it is built off of the Matplotlib library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we have a dataset called **flu.csv** that says whether patients have tested positive or negative for flu at a clinic in the past week. The first five elements in the column Results are shown below.\n",

    "| Result   |\n",

    "| Positive |\n",

    "| Positive |\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create a bar chart that plots the counts of each of the values positive and negative within the Results column. Let’s walk through this with the help of the pandas library and the seaborn library with the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the necessary libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import flu.csv using the `.read_csv()` method. You can inspect the first five rows of the data with the .head() method in pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flu_results = pd.read_csv(\"flu.csv\")\n",
    "print(flu_results.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Plot the counts of your intended category with the `.countplot()` method in seaborn. The only required argument of this method is the `x` parameter, which takes in the data column we are plotting. In our case, this is the Results column.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sns.countplot(flu_results[\"Results\"])\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Bar Chart Ordering\n",
    "You will often see bar graphs with bars set in a certain order. This can help communicate meaningful features about your data. Whether our category labels are ordinal or nominal will affect how we want to order our bars and what features we can emphasize. Let’s investigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nominal Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal data has labels with no specific order. Thus, we have a lot of creative freedom when choosing where each bar goes on our chart. One way would order our data is by ascending or descending order. Let’s apply this ordering to our **games.csv** data using the `.value_counts()` pandas method in the `order` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sns.countplot(df[\"victory_status\"], \n",
    "              order=df[\"victory_status\"].value_counts(ascending=True).index)\n",

    "     width=\"400\">\n",
    "     \n",
    "From the way we ordered the graphs, it is immediately clear that `resign` is the most common game outcome and the mode of our `victory_status` column, while `draw` is the least common.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example we have `value_counts(ascending=True)`. If we want the bars in reverse order, we can take ascending=True out of the `.value_counts()` method (descending order is the default). The `index` call specifies the row labels of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordinal Data\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are working with ordinal data, we should plot the data according to our categorical variables. For example, let’s say we want to plot the number of students per grade level at a college. We have a table below, which is a preview data from a **students.csv** file.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Grade Level |\n",

    "| Second Year |\n",
    "| Second Year |\n",
    "| First Year  |\n",
    "| Third year  |\n",
    "| Fourth Year |\n",
    "\n",
    "We can order the categorical values as `First Year`, `Second Year`, `Third Year`, and `Fourth Year` since they are ordinal. Using `.counplot()`, we can input these as a list in the `order` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sns.countplot(df[\"Grade Level\"], \n",
    "              order=[\"First Year\", \"Second Year\", \"Third Year\", \"Fourth Year\"])\n",

    "     width=\"400\">\n",
    "     \n",
    "From this chart, we get takeaways that we couldn’t just from looking at the column of data. We can see that the college had an influx of students for the second year class, as `Second Year` is the mode (most observed value) of the `Grade Level` column of data. All other years have roughly the same number of students. Putting bars in order according to the ordinal data helps us see these patterns and make our visuals informative for readers."

    "## Pie Charts\n",
    "So far in this lesson, we have looked at bar charts as a way to plot categorical data. However, bar charts are not the only option. Often, you will run into pie charts as a way to display categorical data. While bar charts are usually used for visualizing a table of frequencies, pie charts are an alternative when you want to visualize a table of proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pie charts are made up of slices that are combined to make a full circle. Each slice represents a proportion, and the sum of each proportion (slice) adds up to 1 (or 100%).\n",
    "\n",
    "These slices are meant to give viewers a relative size of the data, similar to how bars in a bar chart act. The arc length (size of the slice’s angle) of each slice is proportional to the quantity it represents. This also means that the area of each slice is proportional to this quantity as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into pie chart use cases and how to plot them, we want to address the fact that pie charts are the most issue-ridden graphing visual. We will explore why later in this lesson. They are still one of the most commonly used visualization tools, so learning all about them will prove to be vital as a data analyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason one would use a pie chart is to represent a part-to-whole relationship in your data. If you want to compare relative sizes of your data and see how they all are part of a larger sum while worrying less about their precise sizes, a pie chart may be a good option.\n",
