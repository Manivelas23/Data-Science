    "### Binning Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data analyst or scientist, you will sometimes deal with numerical data that you would like to arrange into different categories. For example, imagine you are looking at the ages of a set of individuals. You might care more about the age category each person falls under (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, etc) than the exact age. The process of transforming numerical variables into categorical counterparts is called “binning.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Binning is a way to group a number of continuous values into a smaller number of “bins”. We see this in the real world quite often. For example, a student’s letter grade is determined by the percentage “bin” they fall under. Moreover, an individual’s tax rate is determined by the income “bin” they fall under.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why bin data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Binning data can be useful in many situations, whether it be to create more appealing visualizations or to improve a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In areas like machine learning, binning data can be helpful to improve the accuracy of predictive models by reducing the noise of the data. For example, if you’re a machine learning engineer working at an investment firm, you might use binning as a technique to improve your stock prediction models by smoothing the data to reduce the impact of small, short term price changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a better understanding of why we bin data, let’s explore how to bin numerical data in Python!\n",

    "* An “education” variable with the values: “high school”, “college”, and “no education”.\n",

    "You may notice that `Liliana`, `John`, and `William` make up most of the data while the other candidates make up a smaller percentage of the overall vote count. If we’re trying to understand the likelihood that each of these candidates is elected in an upcoming vote, it makes sense to collapse the other candidates into a category called “Other.” If we decided not to do this, then our analysis might be more difficult to parse. For example, if we were to plot this data in a pie chart, it would look like this:\n",
